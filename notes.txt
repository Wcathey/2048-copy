refactor notes:

need to be looping through the gridblocks to see which tiles are holding values
when we make any move it needs to append a new tile to the gridblock but
we cant have it append to a div thats holding a tile already

randomPosition creates an array of two positions. refactor to only create one position
then we can call it twice or recursively on start to generate two positions

value on each new tile needs to be either 2 or 4 randomly generated

createtiles is currently making two tiles. we can call it twice using one value on start
